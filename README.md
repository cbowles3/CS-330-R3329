What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?  
This project helped hone my skills in C++ programming, specifically in the area of rendering 3D objects in a scene by 
using OpenGL libraries. Over the course of seven weeks, we have written functions to create basic and complex shapes,
load and create textures to apply to the faces of the shapes, and implement lighting sources to make our scene come 
alive.

What design process did you follow for your project work?  
Pretty much, my work design process was to start by developing the individual functions to create the various meshes 
for the objects. These had to account for the different coordinates and values needed by the shader program such as position,
normals, and UV coordinates (textures). I then worked on making sure the textures were loading and creating properly. 
Once the textures loaded and rendered, I worked on the lighting last.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?  
This is pretty straight forward; I think it is important to create milestones for yourself, such as having the shapes drawn 
with colors applied before moving on to applying textures. This way, we can resource our time better by knowing the parts of 
the project that have been completed.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?  
I used debugging tools in VS2022 way more than any other project to date. Clicking on the error links helped me figure out 
some issues and gain progress with the project.

How did iteration factor into your development?  
Each milestone was effectively a new iteration over the last, adding new features each time. One week would be camera work, 
one would be processing input, etc. One of my only regrets was not considering some things early on, such as the eventual 
stride for some of the mesh creation functions. This changed from 3 to 7, then back to 5, before finally being 8 with the 
last iteration. This was us due to adding certain values to the stride each week (position, RGB values, normals, UV coordinates).

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?  
Going off the last point, after the 5th or 6th milestone, I started to realize that I was having to re-write the mesh creation 
functions constantly. This was a double-edged sword, as it was frustrating but also really helpful in making me understand what 
is going on inside these functions. This taught me that it is important to take as many considerations early on as possible to 
help prevent a large amount of code re-writing.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?  
I am ready to take another course in grpahics programming that is for sure! This was a great class with an engaging professor. 
The final project was cool in that we actually got a cool visual representation of all the knowledge we had gained over the weeks. 
I don't know how hard it will be yet, but I am yearning to learn some more about graphics programming and hopefully continue my 
education with that in consideration.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?  
It will certainly apply if I become a graphics programmer, but there are also skills that I can take away from this course 
regardless. I have learned more about Visual Studio (the debugging features and adding libraries to projects), I have learned how 
to find and credit open source files (for the textures), and I have also learned how to provide better comments for code traceability.
